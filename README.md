## Introduction
In this project, we aim to predict credit limits for customers based on their demographic and financial information. This involves a series of steps which are detailed below.

## Problem Definition
The problem at hand is to predict credit limits for customers using features such as age, gender, income category, etc. Our success metric for this problem is achieving a specified level of accuracy in predicting credit limits.

## Required Libraries
First, we need to import the necessary libraries for this project. We use `pandas` for data manipulation and `numpy` for numerical operations. Specifically, we load our dataset using `pd.read_csv` from a file named "CreditPrediction.csv".

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

## Importing Necessary Libraries
We start by importing the required libraries for our project. These libraries are essential for data handling and processing.

## Data Overview
The dataset consists of customer information across various features such as Customer Age, Gender, Education Level, Marital Status, Income Category, Card Category, etc. Here's a snapshot of the initial rows of our dataset:

```python
# Displaying the first few rows of the dataset
print(df.head())
```

This gives us an overview of the structure and content of our dataset.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves several steps to prepare the data for modeling. These steps include:

1. Handling missing data: We identify columns with missing values and decide on appropriate strategies such as imputation or deletion.
   
2. Data cleaning: Removing duplicates and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
   
3. Feature engineering: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations, scaling numerical features, and normalizing the data.

## Handling Missing Data
We start by identifying columns with missing data and then decide on how to handle these missing values. For instance:

```python
# Counting missing values per column
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Handling missing values in specific columns
# Example:
# Dropping 'Unnamed: 19' column as it doesn't contribute to our target class
df.drop(columns=['Unnamed: 19'], inplace=True)
```

## Categorical Data
We convert categorical data into a numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or mapping to numerical values. For example:

```python
# Example of handling categorical data
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['Gender', 'Marital_Status'])
```

## Data Statistics
We analyze statistical summaries of the data to understand distributions and identify outliers that might affect our model's performance.

```python
# Displaying statistical summaries of numerical columns
print(df.describe())
```

## Removing Outliers
Outliers can skew our model's predictions, so we identify and remove them using statistical methods such as IQR (Interquartile Range).

```python
# Example of removing outliers
# Identify columns with outliers
outlier_columns = ['Customer_Age', 'Credit_Limit']
for col in outlier_columns:
    # Calculate IQR
    Q1 = df[col].quantile(0.25)
    Q3 = df[col].quantile(0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    
    # Remove outliers
    df = df[(df[col] >= Q1 - 1.5 * IQR) & (df[col] <= Q3 + 1.5 * IQR)]
```

## Normalization and Standardization
Before model building, we normalize or standardize our data to reduce noise and ensure consistency across features.

```python
# Example of normalization
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
df[numerical_columns] = scaler.fit_transform(df[numerical_columns])
```

## Conclusion
This README provides an overview of the Credit Limit Prediction project, detailing the steps from data import to preprocessing. Each section corresponds to a crucial aspect of preparing the data for modeling, ensuring that our predictions are accurate and reliable.
